# datruf

Datruf analyzes relatively long (>100 bp unit size) tandem repeats using datander in DAMASKER software developed by Dr. Gene Myers.

Datruf consists of three parts:

* **Runner** executes datruf with many number of reads and output the results.

* **Viewer** receives one read ID and draw figures that are not told by Runner but help understand the sequence structure of the read.

* **Plotter** requires results of datruf or other software for tandem repeat analysis (TRF, mTR, ...) and draws figures for comparison of these results.
