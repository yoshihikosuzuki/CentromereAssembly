# dacenter

Dacenter recieves a set of tandem repeat unit sequences as input from datruf, and assembles them into (hopefully) linear contigs.

Dacenter performs following steps:

* Align start positions of the units
* Peak unit lengths detection
* Representative unit sequences detection
* Encoding of reads by representative units
* Graph construction and path trace

In addition, dacenter provides following visualizations:

* Unit length histogram
* Clustering details
* Assembly graph

## How to use

TBA
