# DAzzler CENTromere clustERing module

Dacenter recieves a set of tandem repeat unit sequences as input from datruf, and performs clustering of them with several resolutions required in each stage of the assembly.

Dacenter performs following steps:

* Align start positions of the units
* Peak unit lengths detection
* Detect representative unit sequences

In addition, dacenter provides following visualizations:

* Unit length histogram
* Clustering details

## Usage

See [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yoshihikosuzuki/CentromereAssembly/blob/master/dacenter/docs/Usage.ipynb).
